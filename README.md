# PyBer_Analysis
Analyzing ride share data &amp; providing data visualizations 

## Overview of the analysis:
This analysis dives into ride share data to compare trends between urban, suburban and rural rides. The goal of this analysis is to help improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Results:
#### PyBer Summary 
![pyber_summary](Resources/pyber_summary.png)

Through this analysis we can see that we have the highest number of rides & drivers in urban areas. This shouldn't be surprising, given in urban areas tend to be more dense. On the other hand, average fare per ride & per driver is the highest in rural areas. The less dense a region tends to be, the more costly the ride share service becomes. This could be because there is less demand, and less drivers available in these areas, as shown in the Total Rides and Total Drivers results. 

#### Total Fare by City Type

This is a line chart comparing the total fares on a weekly basis between each city type for Jan-April in 2019. Urban rides generate the highest total fares even though they typically charge the least per ride. 

### Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
